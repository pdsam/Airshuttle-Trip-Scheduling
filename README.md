# AirShuttle Trip Scheduling :minibus::airplane:
Airport transfer service trip scheduling application.


#### Final grade: 20


### Description
The aim of this project was to plan the trips of a fleet of vans owned by a transfer service company for a determined day, taking in consideration a given set of client reservations. Each one of these specifies a number of passengers and a destination.

Our objective was to find the best possible combinations of passengers in each van, as to optimize the vans' trips and minimize the clients' waiting time.

We represented the maps using **Graphs**, having to deal with related problems, such as **shortest path** or **connectivity**, among others.

We divided our problem into 3 iterations, of increasing complexity. We found ourselves dealing with a problem both similar to the **Travelling Salesman Problem** (2nd iteration) and the **Vehicle Routing Problem** (3rd iteration).

Different strategies of mixing passengers were considered, in an attempt to find the most optimal one.

We analized the **complexity** of all the algorithms we developed, both theoretical and empirical.
